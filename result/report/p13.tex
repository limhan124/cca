We use \texttt{taskset} command  to pin a process on a specific set of CPU cores.
\emph{\textbf{(a)}} For interference \texttt{CPU}, \texttt{l1d}, \texttt{l1i}, and \texttt{l2}, the
related components are private to a single CPU core, so we have to use the same core as
\texttt{memcached}. 
\emph{\textbf{(b)}} For interference \texttt{llc} and \texttt{memBW}, the related components are
public across CPU cores, so we want to use different cores from \texttt{memcached} to reduce
unwanted influences.
