\emph{\textbf{(a)}} \texttt{ferret} and \texttt{freqmine} are to a great extent sensitive to CPU, while others display a moderate sensitivity.
\emph{\textbf{(b)}} \texttt{ferret} and \texttt{freqmine} show minor sensitivity to \texttt{l1d}, while others display a moderate sensitivity.
\emph{\textbf{(c)}} Almost all applications are to a great extent sensitive to \texttt{l1i}, while only \texttt{canneal} displays moderate sensitivity.
\emph{\textbf{(d)}} Almost all applications show minor sensitivity to \texttt{l2}, while \texttt{fft} shows a moderate sensitivity.
\emph{\textbf{(e)}} Almost all applications are to a great extent sensitive to \texttt{llc}, while \texttt{blackscholes} and \texttt{freqmine} show moderate sensitivity.
\emph{\textbf{(f)}} Almost all applications show moderate sensitivity to \texttt{memBW}, while \texttt{ferret} displays significant sensitivity to \texttt{memBW}.
